## Strings
### Basics to remember.
- String in javascript are sequences of Unicode character.
- We can use length function to calculate the length of the string. `'Hello'.length; //5`
- We can also use string like objects and access the methods and constants associated with the string object. `'Hello'.charAt(0); //H` `'Hello'.toUpper(); //HELLO`
