## Assemblies
### Basics

- Assembly is a logical grouping of one or more modules or resource files. It is smallest unit of reuse, security and versioning.
- An assembly can also be called a component.
- Each assembly contains a block of data called the manifest. Manifest is simply another set of metadata tables. These tables describe the files that make up the assembly, the publicly exported types implemented by the files in the assembly, and the resource or data files that are associated with the assembly.
